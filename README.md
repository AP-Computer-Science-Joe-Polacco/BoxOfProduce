# BoxOfProduce

Complete two classes:

1. BoxOfProduce.java (See instructions in the javadoc of the source code.)
2. BoxOfProduceMain.java (Write a main method that tests the functionality of your BoxOfProduce class/data type. As long as you test each method in your BoxOfProduce class at least once, you will earn full credit for this part.)


Submit the two files to codePost for testing and grading.

A sample text file, produce.txt, is also included if you'd like to use this one (or make your own).
Make sure you include it in the same directory as your source code (if using BlueJ). (That is, dump 
it in the same folder as BlueOfProduce.java.)

I have included the code for reading from a text file in the constructor for BoxOfProduce, as we will cover that in a later unit.
