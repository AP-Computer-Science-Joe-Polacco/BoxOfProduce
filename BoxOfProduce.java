/**
 *  Your Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) farm delivers a box of fresh fruits
 *  and vegetables to your house once a week. For this programming project, define the
 *  class BoxOfProduce that contains exactly three bundles of fruits or vegetables. 
 *  You can represent the fruits or vegetables as three instance variables of type String
 *  or an array of String objects or any other appropriate alternative. Add
 *  appropriate constructor, accessor, and mutator methods as defined below. 
 *  Also write a toString() method that returns as a String the complete contents of the box.
 *  
 *  Your BoxOfProduce should contain THREE items randomly selected from a list of FIVE options:
 *  
 *  For example:
 *  
 *  Broccoli
 *  Tomato
 *  Kiwi
 *  Kale
 *  Tomatillo
 *  
 *  This list should be stored in a text file that is read in by your program. 
 *  You can assume that the list contains exactly five types of fruits or vegetables,
 *  each unique.
 *  
 *  Your BoxOfProduce object should randomly select (each equally likely) three items, 
 *  WITHOUT duplicates, that will go in the box.
 *  This should be handled in the constructor. You may decide to call a private helper
 *  method in your constructor; for example, this private method header might look something like this: 
 *  
 *          private void randomizeBoxProduce()
 *  
 *  Next, the main method should display the contents of the box and allow
 *  the user to substitute any one of the five possible fruits or vegetables for any of the
 *  fruits or vegetables selected for the box. It is okay to allow duplicates at this point. 
 *  Perhaps the customer wants a double order of Kale  and a single order of Broccoli. 
 *  After the user is done with substitutions, output the final contents of the box to be delivered. 
 *  
 *  You should also write a toString() method that returns a String representation of your 
 *  BoxOfProduce object.
 *  Feel free to create any additional private helper methods.
 *  
 *  
 *  
 *  Sample run:
 *  
 *  There are five items this week:
 *  Broccoli
 *  Tomato
 *  Kiwi
 *  Kale
 *  Tomatillo
 *  
 *  Your box contains:
 *  Kiwi
 *  Kale
 *  Tomato
 *  
 *  Would you like to make a substitution(y/n)? 
 *  y
 *  
 *  What item would you like to substitute? 
 *  Tomato
 *  
 *  What would you like to replace it with?
 *  Kiwi
 *  
 *  Here is your new order:
 *  Kiwi
 *  Kale
 *  Kiwi
 *  
 *
